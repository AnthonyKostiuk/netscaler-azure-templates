Netscaler Azure templates
--------------------------------------

## Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository for Citrix Netscaler Azure templates. This is a repository for [Citrix NetScaler's](https://www.citrix.com/products/netscaler-adc/) templates for deploying Citrix NetScaler in Microsoft Azure Cloud Services. All of the templates in this repository have been developed by the NetScaler engineering team. 

## Citrix NetScaler VPX
Citrix NetScaler VPX is a virtual application delivery controller that combines the latest cloud-native features with a simple user experience. The NetScaler optimizes the user experience ensuring that applications are always available by using advanced L4-7 load balancing, traffic management and proven application acceleration such as HTTP compression and caching.

## Citrix NetScaler VPX in Azure
Citrix NetScaler VPX offers are available as resources in the Azure portal. This repository is an extension to provide additional deployments supported by Citrix.

## About these templates
Each template in this repository has co-located documentation describing the usage and architecture of the template. The templates attempt to codify recommended deployment architecture of the Citrix NetScaler VPX, or to introduce the user to the Citrix NetScaler or to demonstrate a particular feature / edition / option. Users can re-use / modify or enhance the templates to suit their particular production and testing needs. Most templates require sufficient subscriptions to portal.azure.com to create resource and deploy templates.

## Versioning
The master branch of the repository generally has the latest version of the template. Older released versions are tagged appropriately

## Support
For production issues with the templates, please contact Citrix Support through your normal support channels. If you have fixes / suggestions for improvements or requests, please raise an issue in this repository.
